// =====
// SUSY GRIDS CLASSES
// =====

// Usage: @import this partial wherever you need to @extend the "column" classes.

// An @import of this partial is already done in site.scss, which is sufficient for just using these classes in DOM;
// therefore, if you don't intend to @extend, don't @import this file.

// If possible, prefer @extend-ing classes over @include-ing mixins

@import "susyMixins";


// USE THESE AS .column-N IN DOM, OR IN FORM OF
// @extend .column-N

@for $i from 1 through $total-columns {

	.column-#{$i} {
		@include ___column_gen($i);
	}

}




// USE THESE AS .prefix-N IN DOM, OR IN FORM OF
// @extend .prefix-N

@for $i from 1 through ($total-columns - 1) {

	.prefix-#{$i} {
		@include ___prefix_gen($i);
	}

}




// USE THIS AS .omega IN DOM, OR IN FORM OF
// @extend .omega

.omega {
	@include omega-margin;
}




// STANDARD CENTRAL COLUMN
// Always use this to contain grid and other contents

.centralColumn {
	@include container;
	display: block;
	position: relative;
}
